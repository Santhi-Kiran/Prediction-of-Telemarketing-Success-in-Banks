Project Title: Prediction of Telemarketing Success in Banks

This project aims to predict the likelihood of customers subscribing to a term deposit after being contacted through a telemarketing campaign. By leveraging machine learning models, the project seeks to enhance the effectiveness of marketing campaigns for a Portuguese bank, reducing costs and focusing efforts on high-potential leads.

Purpose:

The primary objective of this project is to build and evaluate predictive models (Logistic Regression and Random Forest Classification) to forecast the success of telemarketing efforts.
